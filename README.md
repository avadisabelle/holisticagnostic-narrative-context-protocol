# Universal Narrative Model (UNM)

**An Open Protocol for Narrative Context Across Multi-Agent Systems**

The **Universal Narrative Model (UNM)** serves as an open and standardized framework—analogous to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—specifically crafted for narrative content. Designed originally in collaboration with the **Entertainment Technology Center** at the **University of Southern California**, the UNM enables seamless preservation and transmission of narrative context and artistic voice across diverse storytelling platforms, mediums, and multi-agent systems.

At its core, the UNM provides **a flexible and portable protocol** that ensures logical consistency and emotional depth in storytelling. By encoding narrative structures into universally understandable Storyforms, the UNM makes it possible for narratives to retain their original artistic intent, even when interacted with or expanded upon by multiple autonomous agents.

In addition, the UNM functions like a "blockchain-for-subtext," tracking narrative contributions, collaboration, and creative integrations transparently and effectively. This ensures that the original voice and intent of artists remain intact, clear, and traceable—no matter how many agents or platforms engage with their work.

Inspired by an established narrative theory and informed by contemporary technological advances, the UNM simplifies and standardizes complex narrative interactions. It empowers creators and communities across film, television, literature, interactive experiences, gaming, and AI-driven generative storytelling to collaborate effectively without compromising artistic authenticity or narrative coherence.

## Purpose and Philosophy

As storytelling mediums evolve rapidly, maintaining a structured yet adaptable narrative model becomes increasingly vital. The UNM meets this challenge by providing a comprehensive yet adaptable framework that supports narrative coherence while accommodating the complexities and dynamic requirements of modern storytelling methodologies.

By clearly delineating narrative structure (Subtext) from presentation (Storytelling), the UNM preserves authorial intent while enabling adaptable delivery across diverse storytelling platforms.

### Authorship, AI, and Creative Intent

As AI-driven storytelling rapidly evolves, crucial questions emerge about authorship, originality, and rights. The UNM addresses these concerns transparently, embedding authorial intent within its structure, ensuring creators' original decisions remain clearly documented and respected.

By borrowing concepts familiar to collaborative software development—such as transparent tracking of narrative revisions and collaborative decision-making—the UNM preserves the integrity and clarity of each author's contributions. This open and collaborative approach safeguards authorship while fostering creativity and innovation.

With the UNM, the often informal process of giving and receiving notes transforms into a clearly documented system. **Creators' decisions are recorded, attributed, and protected, preserving the integrity and originality of their contributions.** By maintaining authorial intent at its core, the UNM framework not only safeguards authorship but also provides a robust and respectful foundation for collaborative storytelling in an increasingly AI-driven creative environment.
