# Universal Narrative Model (UNM)

**An Open Framework for Crafting Logical Consistency and Emotional Fulfillment in Storytelling**

The **Universal Narrative Model (UNM)** provides an open, accessible standard for understanding and constructing Storyforms--narrative structures designed to achieve logical consistency and emotional resonance. Originally developed as an open-initiative project with the **Entertainment Technology Center** at the **University of Southern California**, the UNM offers a transparent framework inspired by established narrative theories and modern storytelling methodologies.

At its heart, the UNM is **a flexible and portable file format** designed to facilitate sharing and collaboration across different storytelling mediums, platforms, and creative communities. In addition to making it easier for an author to transfer their work from one medium to the next, the UNM also provides an easily trackable "blockchain-for-subtext" approach to contribution and collaboration.

Drawing inspiration from foundational narrative theories and recent developments in technology, the UNM simplifies complex narrative relationships into a clear, community-driven format. Its goal is to educate, inspire, and empower storytellers across various mediums, including film, television, literature, interactive media, gaming, and AI-driven generative content.

## Purpose and Philosophy

As storytelling mediums evolve rapidly, maintaining a structured yet adaptable narrative model becomes increasingly vital. The UNM meets this challenge by providing a comprehensive yet adaptable framework that supports narrative coherence while accommodating the complexities and dynamic requirements of modern storytelling methodologies.

By clearly delineating narrative structure (Subtext) from presentation (Storytelling), the UNM preserves authorial intent while enabling adaptable delivery across diverse storytelling platforms.

### Authorship, AI, and Creative Intent

As AI-driven storytelling rapidly evolves, crucial questions emerge about authorship, originality, and rights. The UNM addresses these concerns transparently, embedding authorial intent within its structure, ensuring creators' original decisions remain clearly documented and respected.

By borrowing concepts familiar to collaborative software development—such as transparent tracking of narrative revisions and collaborative decision-making—the UNM preserves the integrity and clarity of each author's contributions. This open and collaborative approach safeguards authorship while fostering creativity and innovation.

With the UNM, the often informal process of giving and receiving notes transforms into a clearly documented system. **Creators' decisions are recorded, attributed, and protected, preserving the integrity and originality of their contributions.** By maintaining authorial intent at its core, the UNM framework not only safeguards authorship but also provides a robust and respectful foundation for collaborative storytelling in an increasingly AI-driven creative environment.
