# Universal Narrative Model (UNM)

## The Foundation of Logical Consistency and Emotional Fulfillment in Storytelling

The **Universal Narrative Model (UNM)** is the definitive open-source standard for crafting Storyforms that ensure both logical consistency and emotional fulfillment in narrative structures. Developed by the **Entertainment Technology Center at the University of Southern California (ETC@USC)**, the UNM provides a structured yet flexible framework crucial for modern storytelling across film, television, literature, interactive media, gaming, and AI-driven generative content.

At its core, the UNM is a **portable file format** specifically designed for transporting narrative structures seamlessly across different platforms and applications. While the UNM identifies the spatial components of narrative structure, the transformation of these components into temporal storytelling elements (or story "beats") is achieved through algorithms and methodologies originally pioneered by **Write Brothers, Inc.** and further advanced by **Narrative First, Inc.**

Rooted in foundational concepts derived from **Dramatica®**, the UNM advances storytelling into the future with innovative AI-enhanced methodologies introduced by **Subtxt™**.

## Purpose and Philosophy

As storytelling mediums evolve rapidly, maintaining a structured yet adaptable narrative model becomes increasingly vital. The UNM meets this challenge by providing a comprehensive yet adaptable framework that supports narrative coherence while accommodating the complexities and dynamic requirements of modern storytelling methodologies.

By clearly delineating narrative structure (Subtext) from presentation (Storytelling), the UNM preserves authorial intent while enabling adaptable delivery across diverse storytelling platforms.
