All proposed changes to the UNM model are reviewed by **Narrative First‚Äôs core maintainers**, with opportunities for academic and industry partners‚Äîincluding ETC‚Äîto provide feedback and insights.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Submitting Issues & Proposals  

We encourage contributions that enhance UNM‚Äôs structure, computational modeling, and AI integration. However, certain elements of UNM **are intentionally left flexible to allow for diverse implementations**.  

üö® **Note on Justification Process**: The Justification process (Dynamics √ó Storypoints = Storybeats) is an essential narrative structuring method, but its **specific implementation is left to individual adopters**. As such, modifications or additions to Justification methodology **will not be accepted into the core UNM specification**, though discussions on best practices are welcome.
