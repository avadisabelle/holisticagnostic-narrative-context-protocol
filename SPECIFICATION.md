# Justification Process & Implementation Flexibility  

The Universal Narrative Model (UNM) incorporates a Justification process, in which narrative components are matched, compared, and ordered—leading to the formation of Storybeats (Dynamics × Storypoints = Storybeats). This process is based on existing technology and computational methods used for structuring narratives.  

However, the specific method by which organizations apply Justification varies, depending on their needs, storytelling goals, and technological capabilities. For this reason, UNM does not prescribe a single implementation of Justification in the open-source specification.  

Instead, adopters of UNM are encouraged to:  
- Develop their own internal processes for applying Justification within their storytelling pipelines.  
- Leverage existing AI and computational models to refine narrative sequencing as needed.  
- Share best practices and contribute insights on effective Justification methods through the UNM open-source community.  

By keeping the Justification process implementation-agnostic, UNM ensures that organizations can adapt the model to their specific storytelling needs while maintaining structural integrity.
