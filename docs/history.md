# Evolution & Development of the Universal Narrative Model (UNM)  

## Origins  
The **Universal Narrative Model (UNM)** was developed as a next-generation narrative framework, designed to enhance **narrative consistency, scalability, and AI-driven applications**.  

While UNM acknowledges early contributions from various narrative theorists, its methodology has been significantly refined through **new computational modeling, algorithmic improvements, and modern AI-compatible structures**.  

## Key Innovations  
ðŸ”¹ **Algorithmic Refinements** â€“ UNM improves upon prior narrative models by enhancing event sequencing and structural alignment.  
ðŸ”¹ **AI & Computational Storytelling** â€“ UNM is optimized for **AI-assisted storytelling**, ensuring scalability for modern creative workflows.  
ðŸ”¹ **Open-Source & Industry Adoption** â€“ Unlike previous proprietary models, UNM is designed to be an **open standard for universal accessibility**.  

## Acknowledgment of Past Research  
UNM was developed with awareness of previous narrative theories but **stands as an independent framework**. While some early discussions involved contributors familiar with previous theories, the **model itself has evolved substantially through new methodologies** that are distinct from earlier structures.
