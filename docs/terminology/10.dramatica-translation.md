# Dramatica Terminology Alignment

The Narrative Context Protocol now mirrors the original Dramatica® storyform vocabulary. Earlier drafts experimented with alternate names (for example, "Dopamine" and "Serotonin" for problem-solving styles). To support backwards compatibility and ease migrations, the table below lists the legacy labels alongside their canonical Dramatica counterparts.
