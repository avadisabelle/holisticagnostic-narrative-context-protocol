# Evolution & Development of the Universal Narrative Model (UNM)

The Universal Narrative Model (UNM) was developed as a next-generation narrative file format, designed to enhance narrative consistency, scalability, and AI-driven storytelling capabilities.

**Version 1.0 of the UNM** mirrors the robust API framework powering Narrative First’s Subtxt™ application (since 2022). Engineered for narrative precision and innovative AI-driven storytelling, the Subtxt model encapsulates an objective, measurable approach to narrative structure.

Narrative First chose to openly share this model, driven by the belief that storytelling should be accessible and transparent to everyone. By opening the "code" behind narrative structure, the goal is to foster creativity, collaboration, and innovation across all storytelling communities.

## The Dramatica Theory of Story

Originally developed by Chris Huntley and Melanie Anne Phillips in the early 1990s, the Dramatica® Theory of Story offered a groundbreaking approach to narrative structure, emphasizing the interplay of multiple perspectives to create cohesive and resonant storytelling experiences. Launched in 1993, and documented comprehensively in their seminal 1994 book, “Dramatica: A New Theory of Story,” it introduced an objective model of narrative that defined clear, measurable dynamics underpinning every compelling story.

By mapping relationships between characters, plot elements, and thematic concerns, Dramatica established itself as a unique and influential framework. The Universal Narrative Model (UNM) builds directly upon this legacy, refining and extending the foundational concepts to embrace modern advancements in AI-driven storytelling.
